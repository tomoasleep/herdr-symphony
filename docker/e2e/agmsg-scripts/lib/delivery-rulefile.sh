# Some agent types integrate by writing a small markdown rules file that tells
# the agent to poll the agmsg inbox after each tool call (gemini, antigravity,
# opencode). Their per-type plug (scripts/drivers/types/<name>/_delivery.sh) is then a one-line
# delegation to rulefile_apply.
#
# Runs in delivery.sh's sourced context: resolve_hooks_file and SKILL_DIR are
# provided by the caller (delivery.sh sources this lib and the type plug).

After each tool call, automatically check the agmsg inbox for unread messages.
